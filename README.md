# Micah-University-project
it is my first complete project as a Ui/Ux designer for a mini school project in which I was the project Lead/manager of my group.
I created the login pages for each of the accessible accounts and their simultaneous dashboards.
Then i converted the figma design into html\css which i sent to one of my trusted backend developer I kept incharge of the project.
